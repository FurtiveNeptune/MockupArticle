I've learned how to effectively research about things I don't know or understand. That is perhaps the biggest skill I've learned. HTML and CSS in general seem to be pretty easy, while I've struggled a little with Javascript and jQuery.
And YES! I have used google and stack overflow a ton on my projects, as well as remaining committed to solving the problem, and resorting to help if needed.
